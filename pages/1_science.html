    <h4>Learning in the Rodent Motor Cortex.</h4>
    <h5>Peters AJ, Liu H, Komiyama T, Annual Review of Neuroscience 2017</h5>
    <p>
        A review of structural and functional changes in the motor cortex
        accompanying motor learning. The motor cortex is implicated
        in controlling movement but it is very malleable with learning, 
        suggesting that it is not merely a conduit to the spinal cord
        but actively changes to better drive learned and dextrous movements.

    <h4>Reorganization of corticospinal output during motor learning.</h4>
    <h5>Peters AJ, Lee J, Hedrick NG, O'Neil Keelin, Komiyama T, Nature Neuroscience 2017</h5>
    <p>      
        Activity in motor cortex corticospinal neurons are flexibly
        related to movement across days but becomes more distinguishable
        for learned movements. This suggests that the output of the 
        cortex to the spinal cord is constantly shifting even to produce
        similar movements, but learning drives activity patterns to become
        more unique for dissimilar movements.

    <h4>Emergence of reproducible spatiotemporal activity during motor learning.</h4>
    <h5>Peters AJ, Chen S, Komiyama T, Nature 2014</h5>
    <p>
        Activity in L2/3 of the motor cortex is flexibly related to 
        movement, becoming more consistent for learned movements. This
        suggests that networks of neurons one step before cortical output 
        become specialized for learned movements.

    monkens in their natural habitat.</p>
