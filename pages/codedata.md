I use MATLAB and all code I write is available for perusal or download 
on my <a href = "https://www.github.com/{{site.github}}">github page</a>.
I also contribute to the <a href = "https://www.github.com/{{site.github}}">
Caradini/Harris lab github</a>.

These repositories are intended for general use and are maintained:
<ul>

<li><a href = "https://github.com/cortex-lab/allenCCF">allenCCF</a>: 
tools to work with the Allen CCF atlas, I wrote the Neuropixels
trajectory explorer 'allen_ccf_npx' </li>
<li></li>

<li><a href = "https://github.com/petersaj/AP_histology">AP_histology</a>: 
a simple MATLAB pipeline to analyze histology images (including 
extracting Neuropixels trajectories)</li>

</ul>
