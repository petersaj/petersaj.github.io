    <h4>Emergence of reproducible spatiotemporal activity during motor learning.</h4>
    <h5>Peters AJ, Chen S, Komiyama T, Nature 2014</h5>
    <h6>Main finding:</h6>
    <p>
        Activity in the motor cortex is flexibly related to movement, 
        becoming more consistent for learned movements.
    </p>
    <p>
        We tracked the activity of neurons in the motor cortex
        over weeks while mice learned a lever-press movement.
        Movements were accompanied by different sets of neurons active
        at variable times, but activity became consistent with learning. 
        Similar movements performed early and late in learning were
        associated with very different activity patterns, suggesting
        that there is no single way for the motor cortex to produce movement, 
        but instead neuronal populations alter their relationship to movement
        through learning.

    <h4>Field study of Monkens.</h4>
    <p>This was a dangerous trek into the jungle to observe
     monkens in their natural habitat.</p>
