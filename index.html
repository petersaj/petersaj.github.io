<p> 
    I am a postdoc neuroscientist in the 
    <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cortexlab/">Carandini/Harris lab at University College London</a>.
    I'm interested in how activity is propagated across and within
    brain regions to ultimately drive behavior.

    In my research, I work with mice to record the activity of large
    populations of neurons during learning and behavior. I have used
    two-photon imaging, Neuropixels electrophysiology, and widefield
    imaging to record activity, in addition to pharmacological and 
    optogenetic methods of activity manipulation. Investigating 
    large-scale activity across the brain is important to shedding light
    on how neurons can collectively produce sensation, cognition, 
    and behavior.
